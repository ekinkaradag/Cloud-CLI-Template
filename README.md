# Cloud Management CLI Template
This is my Introduction to Programming (C++) 2016-2017 fall term project which is also my very first low-level C++ program. We imagined as if we had a cloud server with multiple users and this program had functions to manage them. [Åžeyma Pamuk](https://github.com/theoranger101) was my partner in this project.

We made this project in Visual Studio. We used several functions to manage the cloud database. This project actually isn't very functional and we know that it can be improved. However, this is what was wanted from us, a very simple C++ program.
