# Cloud Management CLI Template
My Introduction to Programming(C++) 2016-2017 fall term project and this is also my very first C++ project. We imagined if we had a cloud server with multiple users and this program had functions to manage them. I had a partner with this project and her name is listed at the top of the source code (Åžeyma Aybala Pamuk).

We made this project in Visual Studio. We used several functions to manage the cloud database. This project actually isn't very functional and we know it can be improved. However, this is what was wanted from us.
